Dennis Shen 590U assignment 2 resubmission
Resubmission-Change:
I changed one sentence in the report. I accidentally wrote multiclass classification instead of
multilabel classification.

'CS590U Assignment 2 report.pdf' has the report
'dshen_data_visualization.png' has the image in the report


The entire submission is to big to submit, so in order to get the same results I had,
A2_Data should be in the same folder as the rest of the files

run 'visualize_data.py' to recreate the graph, the code which runs is at the bottom of the file.
'data_extraction.py' contains all step 2 code
'train_models.py' contains step 3-5 code
I have it set up so that running 'train_models.py' will run step 3-5 in order,
if you want to run only one or some of them you can modify the code at the very bottom of the file.
